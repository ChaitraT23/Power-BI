Steps followed
Step1: Collect data from databases (SQL Server, Excel.)
Step2: Use Power Query Editor to import and preview datasets.
Step3: Convert date fields (check-in, booking date) to proper date types, Remove duplicates, nulls, and errors.
Step4: Create new columns 
Year from Application Date: Year = YEAR([booking_date])
Calculate Cancelled Amount using condition: Cancelled Amt = IF([IsCancelled]=1, [CancelledAmt], 0)
Step5: Link tables using foreign keys (e.g., UserID, DeptID, AppID).
Step6: Create KPIs using DAX formulas:
Total Applications = COUNT([ApplicationID])
Tot Rooms Booked = SUM([RoomCount])
Total App Cost = SUM([Cost])
Cancelled App = CALCULATE(COUNT([AppID]), [IsCancelled]=1)
Cancelled App Amt = CALCULATE(SUM([CancelledAmt]), [IsCancelled]=1)
Step7: Cross-check KPIs with raw data
 Check filter interactions (e.g., gender filter impacts total).
